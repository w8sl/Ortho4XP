to read or modify Ortho4XP related files. Notepad doesn't understand linux
line-ends and will create a mess.

The following instructions are for the script install :

Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based, names might slightly differ for other distros)
-----

sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-requests python3-numpy python3-pyproj python3-gdal python3-shapely python3-rtree python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk p7zip-full libnvtt-bin freeglut3 gdal-bin imagemagick

Arch-based distributions

sudo pacman -S python python-pip python-requests python-numpy python-pyproj python-gdal python-shapely python-rtree python-pillow p7zip freeglut tk podofo netcdf mariadb hdf5 cfitsio postgresql imagemagick

Windows
-------

1) Download and install Python 3 from www.python.org

Just select one for your Windows OS, there is no benefit in our case to
download the pretty lastest version of Python, since you might get difficulties
further down to find modules already built for it. As of 04/2024, Python 3.11. is recommended.

During the installation, check the following options:

"Use admin privileges when installing py.exe"
"Add python.exe to PATH"
->Customize installation, Optional Features:
"pip"
"tcl/tk and IDLE"
"py launcher"
"for all users"
->Next, Advanced Options:
"Install Python 3.11 for all users"
"Add Python to environment variables"
"Precompile standard library"


2) Download binary wheel for GDAL from https://github.com/cgohlke/geospatial-wheels/releases

Pay attention to take the one that corresponds to the Python version which you picked
at Step 1) and to your OS nbr of bits (32 or 64, I guess 64 in all but a few cases).
As an example, if Python 3.11.*  was selected at Step 1) above and you
have a 64bit windows, then you would choose file that contains -cp311- and _amd64
within filename.


Download and install The Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable packages for Visual Studio 2022:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170


3) Open Command Prompt window as a standard user

4) Change directory to Ortho4XP folder (freshly downloaded from Github) and launch:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4) Open Command Prompt window as administrator and execute the following command:

pip install /path to GDAL-***.whl file, downloaded at Step 2)

In order to use the built-in GeoTIFF feature of the custom_zl map or custom_dem source you will need to
add the directory containing gdal.py, gdal_translate and gdalwarp (***/python**/lib/site-packages/osgeo/)
into the system PATH variable.

You should be done. Open Command Prompt window in the Ortho4XP directory 
and launch "python Ortho4XP.py".


macOS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTICE
Ortho4XP uses Python installed via Homebrew. Access path to Homebrew should be on the top of the list. 
For a fresh install - just go to 1) and proceed with the installation. 

If other version of Python has been installed previously, it may be necessary to manually edit hidden file ".zprofile" in your user directory.
The only content of ".zprofile" file, required for proper functionality of Homebrew and Python should be:

Apple Silicon Mac:
eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)

Intel Mac:
eval $(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) In a Terminal window, install Homebrew (https://brew.sh), a package manager:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

2) Read the terminal messages carefully and follow the PATH setting instructions ! 
   It should look like this:  

   Run these two commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH (replace ??? with your user account name):

    Apple Silicon Mac:
    echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/???/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

    Intel Mac:
    echo 'eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/???/.zprofile
    eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"

   Restart the terminal and verify that the path to Homebrew is at the beginning of the list:
    
    echo $PATH

3) On Apple Silicon Mac (if not done already) install Rosetta:

softwareupdate --install-rosetta
   
4) Go to the Ortho4XP folder
cd /path/to/Ortho4XP (cd, space, drag-and-drop Ortho4XP folder into the terminal window, enter)

5) Execute the install script (you have to run "chmod +x ./install_mac.sh" first)
./install_mac.sh

6) Double-click on executable files: 
/Utils/DSFTool, Utils/Triangle4XP, Utils/nvcompress/nvcompress and confirm opening in Security&Privacy settings

7) Launch Ortho4XP
python3.11 Ortho4XP.py
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Semi-automated, guided  Ortho4XP-Python 3.12 venv installation on macOS:

Open the terminal

type chmod +x, space, drag-and-drop z_Install_O4XP_Python3.12_Venv.sh into the terminal window, enter

type chmod +x, space, drag-and-drop z_Start_O4XP_PythonVenv.sh into the terminal window, enter

drag-and-drop z_Install_O4XP_Python3.12_Venv.sh into the terminal window, enter

Follow the terminal output messages for instructions!
