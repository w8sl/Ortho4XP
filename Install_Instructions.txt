NOTICE 1. Windows users: Only use Notepad++ or an equivalent decent editor
to read or modify Ortho4XP related files. Notepad doesn't understand linux
line-ends and will create a mess.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTICE 2. A copy of X-Plane 12 is required.
During the first run of Ortho4XP, configuration variable "custom_overlay_src" should be set to: "../X-Plane 12/Global Scenery/X-Plane 12 Global Scenery" directory
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following instructions are for the script install :


Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based, names might slightly differ for other distros)
-----

sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-requests python3-numpy python3-pyproj python3-gdal python3-shapely python3-rtree python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk p7zip-full libnvtt-bin freeglut3 gdal-bin python3-scikit-fmm


Arch-based distributions

sudo pacman -S python python-pip python-requests python-numpy python-pyproj python-gdal python-shapely python-rtree python-pillow p7zip freeglut tk

(if some of them were not packaged for your distro you can use pip instead, like say, pip install scikit-fmm)


On some Arch-based distributions it may be necessary to build scikit-fmm from source:

git clone https://github.com/scikit-fmm/scikit-fmm.git

cd scikit-fmm

python setup.py install


Windows
-------

1) Download and install Python 3 from www.python.org

Just select one for your Windows OS, there is no benefit in our case to
download the pretty lastest version of Python, since you might get difficulties
further down to find modules already built for it. As of 02/2024, Python 3.11. is recommended.

Make sure during the process that "pip" (package management system for Python)
is installed along and made accessible from your PATH [there is a checkbox
for this during the Python install process]. Check the "Add Python to environment variables" option.

2) Download binary wheel for GDAL from (unofficial) repository https://github.com/cgohlke/geospatial-wheels:

GDAL 3.8.4 for Python 3.11:
https://github.com/cgohlke/geospatial-wheels/releases/download/v2024.2.18/GDAL-3.8.4-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl

GDAL 3.8.4 for Python 3.10:
https://github.com/cgohlke/geospatial-wheels/releases/download/v2024.2.18/GDAL-3.8.4-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl

Pay attention to take the one that corresponds to the Python version which you picked
at Step 1) and to your OS nbr of bits (32 or 64, I guess 64 in all but a few cases).
As an example, if Python 3.11.*  was selected at Step 1) above and you
have a 64bit windows, then you would choose file that contains -cp311- and _amd64
within filename.

Download and install The Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable packages for Visual Studio 2022:

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170


3) From a command window launch:

pip install --upgrade pip  [if this goes wrong you probably missed the last point in 1)]

4) Change directory to Ortho4XP folder (freshly downloaded from Github) and launch:

pip install -r requirements.txt

4) Execute the following command as administrator:

pip install /path to GDAL-***.whl file, downloaded at Step 2)

In order to use the build geotiff feature of the custom_zl map or custom_dem source you will need to
add the directory containing gdal.py, gdal_translate and gdalwarp (***/python**/lib/site-packages/osgeo/)
into the system PATH variable.

You should be done. Open a command window in the Ortho4XP directory 
and launch "python Ortho4XP.py".


macOS
----
It is not recommended to manually download and install Python from www.python.org !
Just follow these steps:

1) In a Terminal window, install Xcode Command Line Tools:

xcode-select --install   

2) Install Homebrew (brew.sh), a package manager:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"


3) Go to the Ortho4XP folder
cd /path/to/Ortho4XP

4) Execute the install script (you have to run "chmod +x ./install_mac.sh" first)
./install_mac.sh

5) Launch Ortho4XP
python3.11 Ortho4XP.py
